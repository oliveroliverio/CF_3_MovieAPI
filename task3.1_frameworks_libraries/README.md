# What Are Libraries and Frameworks?
A library is a prepackaged piece of code that you can incorporate into your project as you like. Think of a library as a box of tools. Libraries range in size from just a few lines of code about very specific things to a range of functions and utilities for all manner of tweaks, features, and functionalities.

A framework, on the other hand, is a predefined structure into which you enter your code. Essentially, a framework determines how your app is built (this is also known as being “opinionated”). By providing a set of universal and reusable functions, frameworks can streamline the building of a certain type of app. As a refresher, the programming language you use is like the raw lumber for creating a table, and the programming framework is the instructions (a set of standards and opinions) on how to create the table.

You can also think of this difference in terms of an inversion of control. When using a library, the developer—you, in this case—is in control. You call the functions as (and when) you want to. With a framework, however, you surrender control of which pieces of the tool you use. You have to follow the framework’s rules and adopt its structure throughout the development process; the framework calls you. In this sense, the control is inverted.
